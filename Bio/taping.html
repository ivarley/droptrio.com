<p><b>Taping? Yes!</b></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#d8d8d8">
<p>We love taping - do it early and often! We ask only that:
<ul>
<li>you <b>not sell</b> recordings of our shows, and 
<li>you <b>send us a copy</b> if you are able
</ul>

That really is the gist of it - taping is permitted and encouraged. If you're not a regular taper, or if you're uncertain about what common taping etiquette is, please do read official legal policy below. Thanks!

<b>Official Drop Trio Taping Policy</b>

<p>Audience taping is permitted at all Drop Trio shows. Recording our performances encourages fan involvement with the band, and it's a way for more people to hear and enjoy our music. Please follow the following guidelines if you wish to tape our shows.

<p>Any and all audio recordings and still photography taped/taken at a live show shall be considered "works-made-for-hire" for Drop Trio within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976 and Drop Trio will own the copyright and all other rights in and to the work. If Drop Trio is playing an event with multiple bands, the taping policy of the headlining band and/or the festival event will be in effect and dictate the taping policy for that show.  All taping of live Drop Trio shows is restricted to audio only; no video taping will be allowed without prior permission. Audio recording is limited to portable equipment which includes microphones and a recorder. Power or other auxiliary equipment are generally not supplied, so be prepared to bring your own battery powered equipment. Soundboard feeds will not generally be allowed. If you wish to tape, we encourage you to arrive early to set up. The audience's enjoyment of a live show is very important to us, and we cannot compromise that to accommodate tapers, so please refrain at all times from requesting fans to move or keep quiet, and respect other fans while you are taping. 

<p>All taping must be for personal and non-commercial use only. No profit is ever to be made from live shows. You are permitted to trade shows with other fans at will. Drop Trio reserves the right to seek legal remedies against anyone that is in violation of this policy. Anyone found taping in violation of the above policy will be removed from the venue and unauthorized recordings may be confiscated. Sorry about that.

<p>While not mandatory, we would appreciate it if you send us a copy of any shows you tape. We generally also tape our own shows, but we always enjoy hearing a second point of view (so to speak). If we ever feature your recording on a live album or release, we will give credit where credit is due and list your name in the album (if you so choose).<BR><br>
