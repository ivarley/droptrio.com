After several years on the road with various artists, Thomas has returned to Houston, where he's one of the city's top call jazz bassists, working with a who's who of local jazz greats, including <a href="http://www.heartmusic.com/artists/joelm.htm">Joe LoCascio</a>, Carol Morgan, Larry Slezak, Gary Norian, and Mike Nase. His interests also extend into the realm of the avant-garde, and his solo playing is original, striking, and not for the weak.
<BR /><BR />

Why does he hang with Drop Trio? We're not really sure, but we're glad he does. You can find Thomas on shows with Drop Trio from time to time, barreling through funky standards or bending minds with his imitation of the apocalypse using nothing but 4 strings and a bow.
