(Bass Guitar)<BR /><BR />
Founder and editor of basszone.net and rockmusicnews.net, Nino is an accomplished musician, designer and writer. He has studied and taught bass for more than 15 years, and has played countless gigs as both a live and studio musician.<BR /><BR />
Nino proudly plays a Rickenbacker bass, through a SWR head and a gigantor Bassman cabinet that's older than he is. And did we mention he was proud of his Ric?
<BR /><BR />
Nino's day gig is as a <a href="http://www.ronelmm.com" target="blank">graphic designer</a>, and his new 24-hour-a-day gig is a father, too! Nino's lovely wife, Tara, gave birth to a new baby girl on April 30, 2004 - her name is <a href="http://www.ronelmm.com/pennie/firstphotos/firstphotos.html">Pennie Layne Batista</a>. With the arrival of Pennie, Nino decided to step down from his post in Drop Trio, but he's never too far away - he's a regular contributor to the blog, and still does most of the band's graphic design work. (You can <a href="http://www.ronelmm.com">hire Nino</a> to do your web site, too ...)<BR /><BR />
