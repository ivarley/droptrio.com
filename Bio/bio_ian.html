(Rhodes piano, Hammond B3 organ)<BR /><BR />
Ian earned a degree in composition and theory from <a href="http://www.skidmore.edu" target="blank">Skidmore College</a>. His performances have included stints with rock bands, straight jazz combos, a cappella groups, and atonal metal bands. He has worked as an arranger, composer, publisher, choir director and performer on all three coasts.<BR /><BR />
For instruments, Ian plays a Fender Rhodes 73 Key Suitcase and a Roland VK-7. He also makes unusual (and often uncomfortable) sounds with his Digitech Whammy and his Line 6 Delay pedal, among other goodies.<BR /><BR />
When Ian's not on the road with Drop Trio, he programs computers, DJs on the local Rice University Radio Station (<a href="http://www.ktru.org" target="blank">KTRU</a>) and makes a nuisance of himself to his wife, Jill.<BR /><BR />
