I've asked around a few printing places in my search for cheap printing. I've found that office depot is the cheapest. I can't recall the prices right this second, but once you've figured out what you're going to do for postcard (front or front/back, color, paper), then I can get price quotes for you.<br />
I've found the easiest way to do postcards and not have to worry about things getting cut off is make the postcard 5.5 by 4.25 inches (or 4.25 x 5.5, depending on if it's landscape or portrait, but leave .25 inches around each side of the postcard as a "bleed" area so that the cards can be cut without messing up any words. if you have quark or indesign, you can pull a guide ruler to mark off the .25 inch. Let me know if that helps. Basically you layout of the 4 postcards on a 8.5 x 11 inch document, but assume that a quarter inch on each side could possibly be cut.    </body>
