Track 1:<br />
<br />
Here's the structure, as I see it:<br />
A intro (with 8 measures of bass in the high octave),<br />
A, B, A, B, A, B prime<br />
<br />
Drums: <br />
-All A sections use the drum loop taken from :21.<br />
-All B sections use the drum loop taken from<br />
2:51-whatever feels best<br />
-B prime is taken as the outro from 2:51 to 3:20<br />
<br />
Bass: <br />
-A section intro 8 measures looped of the measure at<br />
:21<br />
-for the first two B sections starts at 1:31.  <br />
-B prime is at 2:51-3:20.<br />
<br />

film music:<ul>at 21 seconds GPF is playing high - that should be in the intro, but then use GPF lower bass for body of song<br />
<br />
Use patrick's B section with nuje's C section drums</ul>
