Hi friends,<br />
<br />
It's that time again - we're booking dates at Brasil for Funk Jazz Fridays.<br />
<br />
If you're currently in a project that a) can play instrumental, b) isn't super loud, c) can play something like jazz or funk, ideally with original material, and d) is willing to play on a Friday for $100 (whole band, not per person) and really good exposure ... then this is the gig for you.<br />
<br />
We've got the following dates, first-come first-served:<br />
<br />
{ dates }<br />
<br />
Also, if you know of any other bands (in Houston or elsewhere) who might like something like this, feel free to pass them along to me. The pay's not great, but I know the majority of my band's mailing list came from shows there over the years. If that's what you're going for, it's a good gig.<br />
<br />
And yes, we do occasionally have djs, but live bands usually get first pick (that's what the club prefers).<br />
<br />
FYI - I'm working on the club management to up the pay scale a bit, and / or include some food &amp; drink benefits in the deal. I'll keep you posted on that.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
