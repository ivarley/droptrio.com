Hey guys -<br />
<br />
My name's Ian Varley. I play with a band called Drop Trio, based in Austin. Just found your site through Jambase, and you guys sound killer. I wish more people did such great meld of hip hop and live band grooves.<br />
<br />
Drop Trio is doing a Colorado tour in late march, as are you guys, and we've got a couple dates to fill in. I saw that you guys have shows on 3/24 in Nederland and 3/25 in Keystone, which are both nights we're looking for spots. If you could use an opener on either night, we'd love to do it. (We play instrumental funk / jazz, lots of free improv &amp; heavy grooves ... Hammond Organ, Fender Rhodes, bass &amp; drums).<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think, and thanks.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />
Ian<br />

Hello -<br />
<br />
My name is Ian Varley, and I play with an instrumental jazz band from<br />
Austin, TX, called Drop Trio (www.droptrio.com). We're working on a tour<br />
through Colorado in late march, and we'd love to play a show at the<br />
Sidecar anywhere in the time span of 3/23-3/26. I'd be happy to send a<br />
press kit if you are interested, or you can check our our online press<br />
kit as well:<br />

If you want to reach the young crowd go to Navajo Hogan's.  It's a bit of a<br />
dive bar, but the place for indie rock, blues and other popular music. It<br />
might fit your style well. There is also a new jazz club called Cedars,<br />
right off the interstate.  Unfortunately there is not much of a music scene<br />
or crowd in C. Springs, but you will be able to find bars that will pay.<br />
I don't have there numbers on hand but if you can't find them e-mail me back<br />
and I'll get you the info. Best of luck. - Thomas Delong<br />

A couple of places I've heard radio ads for that sound like they might be a fit for y'all are Dulcinea's 100th Monkey, and possibly Cricket on the Hill. Another possible is Sancho's Broken Arrow. Websites are:<br />
<br />
www.quixotes.com (for Dulcinea's and Sancho's)<br />
<br />
www.cricketonthehill<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, I see Devin the Dude is playing at the other Quixotes place, Cervantes' Masterpiece Ballroom, on June 11. I don't really know anything about that place.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I'm sure y'all would be big in Boulder, which is very Austin-like. Alas, I don't know any places to play there, but we're moving near there this summer. I'll try to sniff around and find a suitable venue. <br />
<br />

Yes, I know some clubs with crowds that would receive your band very well here in Denver.  One place is called "Dulcinea's 100th Monkey" you can check it out a bit at www.quixotes.com.  Another place is called 1515 on Market street Downtown.<br />
<br />
I have good friends who play theses venues frequently and I have played there in the past.  There is also a great club scene in Boulder which is 30 minutes away situated at the base of the rockie mountains.  <br />

Ian,<br />
<br />
Good to hear about the tour west.  I live in a suburb between Boulder<br />
and Denver but I tend to see most of my shows at the Fox Theatre in<br />
Boulder.  They pull a crowd from CU and have a long history of bands<br />
that went on to big things.  Robert Walter usually plays there, so does<br />
Galactic and MMW although less so now that they can play bigger venues.<br />
So that's the one in boulder to shoot for.  Trilogy Winebar is another<br />
jam-friendly smaller venue which you could look at in boulder.<br />
<br />
In Denver, you can look into the Gothic Theater which tends to get<br />
bigger name acts.  There are a couple small venues which are run by the<br />
same guys: Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom and Dulcinea's 12th Monkey are<br />
pretty good smaller venues with jam-friendly crowds.  See this link:<br />
<a href="http://www.quixotes.com/">http://www.quixotes.com/</a><br />
<br />
Not sure where else in Colorado you're thinking of going.  I don't go<br />
down to the Springs much.  In the mountains, you can look into some<br />
places in Vail.  One place you can look into is called "8150" which gets<br />
some good music. Springtime in the mountains is a pretty nice place to be.<br />

this is Ryan from One Big Groove.  We are now residence of Breckenridge,<br />
CO.  So if you're ever in the area with a gig or just passing through let<br />
us know.  You guys are always welcome to stay.  Also, if you want any<br />
venue info or anything of that sort from this area let me know as well<br />
and I'll do what I can for you.  Hope everything's good down in Houston.<br />
