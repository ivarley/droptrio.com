<ul><li /><a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/sets/2006-05-26_Brasil/">Brasil 2006-05-26</a> - Again, Minidisc sound quality isn't so hot, but it's a decent recording. Some hurtin' stuff in the first set, IMO, but also some redeeming qualities.<li /><a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/sets/2006-04-07_Helios/">Helios 2006-04-07</a> - Only the second set (plus the last song from set 1, abbey). Kinda crappy sound quality, but it works to show the performance, which was RAD.</ul>
