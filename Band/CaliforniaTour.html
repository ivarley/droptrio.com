Here is some venue information:<br />
<ul><li />Moe's Alley. - <a href="http://www.moesalley.com/">http://www.moesalley.com/</a><li />Kuumbwa Jazz Center - <a href="http://www.kuumbwajazz.org/contact/index.htm">http://www.kuumbwajazz.org/contact/index.htm</a><li />The Attic - <a href="http://www.theatticsantacruz.com/booking.htm">http://www.theatticsantacruz.com/booking.htm</a><br />
</ul>
I think Moe's Alley might be a good fit.  Looking at their page I don't see any contact information for a booking agent.  They have a number to call for renting the club out.  The folks at that number might be able to direct you to their booking agent.<br />
<br />
The Kuumbwa webpage is similar, I don't see booking agent contact information.  They are really nice folks and I suspect they might be the most helpful in directing you towards a booking agent.<br />
<br />
"The Attic" is a restaurant and cafe that also has musical acts.<br />
<br />
There are some other venues in Santa Cruz that I don't frequent as much:<br />
<ul><li />The Catalyst - <a href="http://www.catalystclub.com/">http://www.catalystclub.com/</a><li />The Coastline Brewery (a new pub that has live music) - <a href="http://www.coastlinebrewery.com/">http://www.coastlinebrewery.com/</a><br />
</ul>
The Catalyst frequently books well known acts (I've seen John Mclaughlin, Parliament and others there).  The Coastline might be a bit small for you guys.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be in Wimberly (between Austin and San Antonio) April 22 through April 24.  It doesn't look like you guys are doing any local shows then (drat).<br />
<br />
Feel free to drop me a line if there is anything I can do to help you make Santa Cruz one of your tour stops.<br />
