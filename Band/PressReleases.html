Press release:<h3>Drop Trio Brings Spaceship Jazz to SXSW</h3>
SXSW Showcase: Elephant Room, Thursday 3/16 @ 1am<br />
<br />
<i>Feb 24, 2006</i><br />
<br />
A statistical breakdown of the 1300+ bands playing this year's South By Southwest Music festival would show that compared to Indie Rock (51.6%), Singer / Songwriters (9.8%), and Alt-Country (7.7%), the genre <b>Spaceship Jazz</b> is drastically under-represented - coming in at less than 0.1%.<br />
<br />
Doing their part to right this imbalance is Texas' <b>Drop Trio</b>. Formed in 2002, the instrumental band has played relentlessly across the southern United States, inspiring legions of fans with their improvised prog-rock jazz. A bevy of media awards (such as Houston Press' "Best Jazz" and "Album Of The Year") put the trio on local radar, and frequent out-of-state trips promise to broaden their reach nationally.<br />
<br />
Describing their music as "Herbie Hancock meets E.T.", the trio welds together influences as diverse as Steve Reich and P-Funk. "George Clinton spaceships? You bet," said bassist Patrick Flanagan. "But too, it's Brian Eno spaceships, ELP spaceships, and Sun Ra spaceships."<br />
<br />
Drop Trio has released three albums, the latest a live recording from Houston's prestigious jazz venue, <i>Cezanne</i>. Each release has seen Drop Trio evolve, and their latest voyages put them squarely in the domain of spaceships - heavy doses of analog synthesizers and vintage organs, mixed with funk jazz beats and a careening, mixed-meter, composition-heavy approach.<br />
<br />
"Basically, we're thinking about the future," said keyboardist Ian Varley. "We're into the future, and finding our way to it from the past." <br />
<br />
"I guess it's basically just the present we're not into," added drummer Nuje Blattel. "Present = boring. Next question."<br />
<br />
The band will be headlining at the venerable Austin jazz club, The Elephant Room (315 Congress), on Thursday, March 16th, at 1am. For more details, visit <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">http://www.sxsw.com</a> <br />
