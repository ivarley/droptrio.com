   <div style="clear:both;"></div>This Saturday, one of Houston's own legendary jazz pianists, <a href="http://www.jazzhouston.com/artists/profile.jsp?key=89">Joe LoCascio</a>, will be performing at <a href="http://www.jazzhouston.com/venues/about.jsp?key=7">Cezanne</a>. If you've never heard Joe perform before, or you want to hear some of the most amazing music Houston has to offer, this is one you absolutely cannot miss. Performing with him will be <a href="http://www.thomashelton.com">Thomas Helton</a> on bass (of Drop Trio fame ... haha) and Richard Cholakian on drums. Do yourself a favor and catch this <a href="http://www.jazzhouston.com/events/about.jsp?key=1902">amazing show</a>. We'll see you there.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>The Nuje Report:<br /><br />Ian and I made our way to the <a href="http://www.rush.com">Rush</a> concert last night at the <a href="http://pavilion.woodlandscenter.org/">Woodlands Pavillion</a>. It was Ian's first time seeing the Rush experience, but it was double digits for me - 10 times since 1984.<br /><br />31 songs in 3 1/2 hours might be enough to make our wives (and most of you) jump from tall buildings, but I left wanting more. "Red Barchetta", "Xanadu" (double neck guitar for this one, eh), "Mystic Rhythms" and "Between the Wheels" were among my favorites of the night.  <br /><br />We ran into Alfred (trombone player in <a href="http://clouseaux.tripod.com">Clouseaux</a>) and Spike (aka <a href="http://www.manipulate.net/">Astrogenic Hallucinating</a>) during the show.  Alfred was suprised to find out that I am a long time Neil Peart fan. I see how it might seem strange, with the music we play now, but I cut my teeth on Rush. What Neil lacks in funk he more than makes up for in chops and power. And you know I'm a total sucker for odd times. Rule!<br /><br />Now, if <a href="http://www.yesworld.com/">Yes</a> will ever tour again I'm sure Ian will drag us to go see them. Oooh, maybe <a href="http://www.king-crimson.com/">King Crimson</a> will pass through town soon.<br /><br />- Nuje<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

    <div class="Post"><a name="108829094280429673">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>Thanks to all of you guys who came out to Brasil last night. We had a great time and pulled a pretty cool couple of sets out of ... well, out of where the sun don't shine. Daniel Beatty (<a href="http://www.littlebrotherproject.com">LBP</a>) was MVP, stepping up to the plate and throwing down some excellent grooves with less than 1 day's notice. Nick Anaya (<a href="http://www.ellipsisquartet.com/">Ellipsis</a>) also proved what a heavy hitter he is, blowing for our second set and leaving everybody in the crowd speechless. We played a bunch of standards, including Red Clay, Nostalgia In Times Square, Afro Blue, Impressions, Chameleon, and a few Drop Trio tunes as well ... not to mention a couple tunes with some other auspicious guests. All in all, it was a pretty cool night.<br /><br />Now it's time for head-down mode - bringing Leap out of the studio and into the world. But first, Mike and Ian are going to make a little excursion to see <a href="http://www.rush.com">Rush</a> tonight. Should provide us with at least another album's worth of inspiration. Be warned.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

    <div class="Post"><a name="108819739547102094">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>OK, get this - tonight at <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays/">Funk Jazz Fridays</a>, we're doing something a little different. Due to a family situation, Mike can't make our show tonight (don't worry, everything's fine, we'll explain soon). So instead of a last minute cancellation, we decided to throw caution to the wind and try something new.<br /><br />So tonight, we're going to do an open-ended improvisation with Daniel Beatty (the infamous <a href="http://www.littlebrotherproject.com">Little Brother Project</a> <a href="http://littlebrotherproject.blogspot.com">blogger</a>). We may have a few other stop-bys as well (anyone who witnessed our last "Drop Trio & Friends" show at Brasil knows this is a good thing). We'll improvise, maybe play some originals and standards, and just have a good time. Same time (10 pm till 1am), same place (Brasil, 2604 Dunlavy). Come break new ground with us tonight.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>FYI - there's a great show tonight at the <a href="http://www.rhythmroomhouston.com">Rhythm Room</a>. It features 2 great bands you will dig. All you Houstonians will be familiar with the first - <a href="http://www.littlebrotherproject.com">Little Brother Project</a> (Marc, their guitar player, is also an <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Bio/bio.html">occasional contributor</a> to the Drop Trio machine). Fresh off their <a href="http://littlebrotherproject.blogspot.com/2004_05_01_littlebrotherproject_archive.html#108553380799026762">Port Aransas tour</a>, they're bringing their funk jams to the Rhythm Room.<br /><br />Also on the bill are some great friends of ours from Austin, <a href="http://www.collectallfive.com/">Collect All Five</a> (formerly known as <a href="http://collectallfive.blogspot.com/2004/06/name-change.html">Unified Feel Theory</a>). These guys are truly awesome. Do yourself a favor and go check out their <a href="http://www.unifiedfeeltheory.com/music.html">sound samples</a> - fans of Drop Trio will definitely dig it.<br /><br />Great double bill on a Thursday.

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>The art show opening was great. Thanks to Marcus & crew, and all the folks who came out to see us and stayed for the art. Gallery 101 is an excellent space (though the lack of air conditioning made it a bit of a damp show for us all). We started off the set by having Ian and Mike swap instruments. Mike's not particularly good on keys, and Ian is particularly bad on drums, but for some reason, the planets aligned and it sounded pretty cool. (Well, unless you ask the 3 year old girl writhing around on the floor with her hands over her ears, screaming.) <br /><br /><a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/sets/2004-06-12_Gallery101/Gallery101Jam.mp3">Give a listen</a> (mp3, 8.9 MB) Think we should keep the new lineup?

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>Finally got around to updating the info on our <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Bio/bio.html">bio page</a>, complete with an updated <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Press/PressKit.pdf">Press Kit</a> and blurbs about Ian, Nino and The Nuje ... plus, information about some of the other bass players who are part of the Drop Trio family - Patrick, Marc, Thomas, and Adrian. That's not all the bassists we've played with to date (others include Roy Keyes and Guy Schwarz), but those are the suckers we've managed to capture in some sort of "indefinite engagement". :)<br /><br />Next up: our sorely outdated <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Press/press.html">links</a> page.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   The Tidbits</a></span><BR>
   </div>
    <div class="Post"><a name="108673188130920949">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>New addition to the <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays/">funk jazz fridays</a> calendar: The <a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/kcorbet/tidbits/">Tidbits</a> (alternately known as the "Galloping Tidbits", the "Infernal Tidbits", the "Postmodern Tidbits", or any other adjective you can throw at 'em.) Helmed by the happily unhinged Gerard Bendiks of <a href="http://www.swirve.net">Swirve</a> fame, the Mysterious Tidbits bring a bewildering blend of jazz, free improv, and electronica that will keep you listening even after you've decided to stop. They're coming from Dallas on <strong>Friday, June 2nd</strong>. Be warned.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   Benton's</a></span><BR>
   </div>
    <div class="Post"><a name="108653945146304086">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>We had a great time last night at Benton's. After spending a few minutes oohing and aahing over <a href="http://www.ronelmm.com/pennie/firstphotos/firstphotos.html">Nino's new baby</a>, we managed to get our gear set up in time to have a tasty meal. Benton makes the best New Orleans style food in the Woodlands, without a doubt - his Mac & Cheese is my particular favorite, though the Crab & Shrimp au gratin is pretty damn tasty too.<br /><br />And it was excellent to get a chance to play a couple sets with Nino! He proved that it's just like riding a bike - we had a couple great sets. Unfortunately our recorder crapped out on us for the first two, so we didn't get an archive of them. :( But we at least got a tape of the third set.<br /><br />One of the highlights of the evening was when a student of Mike's, Alex (aka "the funky kid"), got up on stage and played "Wreck Of The Zephyr" with us. He totally nailed it - if he were old enough to get into all the bars we play at, Mike would have to worry about his job. ;) We also had a couple fellas from New Orleans sit in on bass & trumpet - they're from a band called Three Straight Up, and they killed a couple blues tunes. Very nice.<br /><br />So now we rest up for next weekend, where we're back at Brasil for <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays/">funk jazz fridays</a>.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   At the bistro</a></span><BR>
   </div>
    <div class="Post"><a name="108647654502795792">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>We could just take yesterday's post and put it up again ... "Last night's show was great, and we're playing again tonight."<br /><br />Mike and I got to <a href="http://www.rudyards.com">Rudyard's</a> around 9 and had a couple drinks with the other band members. (The perpetually early Patrick slept through his alarm, but it was OK, because we didn't go on until later than planned anyway, as is typical at Rudz. But don't expect us to let Mr. Sleepy Head off the hook about it anytime soon.) Mike bumped into his Trombone playing friend Alfred, who is a recent addition to the Clouseaux juggernaut. We discovered a few other funny crossovers - Mike used to work with Jay's wife, etc, etc. <br /><br />Our set was very energetic, egged on by all the enthusiastic folks in the crowd, plus the members of Les Saucy Pants (a teriffic Austin band that reminded us of a cross between the B-52s and a ska band) and of course, <a href="http://clouseaux.tripod.com">Clouseaux</a>. It was nice to finally get to play for each other. We felt like we played one of our best shows in recent memory - things just flowed naturally. Joe O. gave us a great board mix of the show, so if it came out we'll post it here soon. As we expected from this show, the other bands blew us away ... but the show must go on. :)<br /><br />... and tonight, the show does go on, up in the Woodlands at <a href="http://www.woodlandsonline.com/cdps/cditem.cfm?nid=5025">Benton's Bistro</a>. We start around 8, so come on down for some gumbo and funk jazz. And come meet Pennie Layne - this show'll have Nino on bass for the first time since delivery, and we hear he's bringing the young'un.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   June Funk Jazz Fridays Schedule</a></span><BR>
   </div>
    <div class="Post"><a name="108610019412450469">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>We've released the <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays/">schedule for Funk Jazz Fridays in June</a>. <br /><br />On the roster this week (June 4), we've got <a href="http://www.braintone.com/SKETCHY.html">Sketchy</a>, a Houston band with a quirky brand of improvised postmodern pop music. They consist of two horns and drums, playing deconstructions of pop tunes like Duran Duran's "Hungry Like The Wolf" and Madonna's "Material Girl". You have to hear it to believe it. Fans of the weird side of instrumental music, this is your night.<br /><br />In two weeks, we've got visitors from Boston, called (believe it or not)...  <a href="http://www.dropstuff.net">Drop</a>. These guys play a wide spectrum, from jazz to hip hop. At Brasil, they're gonna return to their roots and play an all instrumental jazz / funk / hip hop set. <a href="http://www.dropstuff.net/songs/harrypits.html">Take a listen</a>. The band will be in Houston for a couple weeks, check out their <a href="http://www.dropstuff.net/shows/showspage.html">other local dates</a> as well.<br /><br />Drop Trio plays on the 11th and 25th.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>
