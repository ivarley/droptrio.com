   <div style="clear:both;"></div>Another fine evening was had by all last night at Brasil. Nick played his heart out, and is now (sadly) en route to New Mexico, to figure out the next stage in his life (which will probably involve using his EE degree from Rice in some cool musical way.) We'll miss ya, Nick. We taped the show, so if anyone wants a copy, <a href="mailto:info@droptrio.com">let us know</a>.<br /><br />Tonight, Ian will embark on a strange musical journey, playing a show with the legendary <a href="http://worshipguitars.org/faq/lp4.html">Linus Pauling Quartet</a>. The group is making a rare foray to <a href="http://www.rudyards.com">Rudz</a>, supported by Austin's excellent <a href="http://www.st37.com/">ST-37</a> (and Houston's own king of weird music, Muzak John).

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>We spent the early part of the evening yesterday over at Essential Sound, mastering Leap with Allen Corneau. The audio quality is fantastic! The artwork is being finished as we speak, and it'll go to duplication next week.<br /><br />After leaving the studio, we headed over to <a href="http://www.superhappyfunland.com">Super Happy Fun Land</a> to catch The <a href="http://www.lymbycsystym.com">Lymbyc Systym</a>. These guys were outstanding! Super high energy, great communication. To quote Brad Martin of the Psychodillos:<blockquote>For those of you that snoozed on Wed night.  Lymbyc Systym (out of Phoenix) played at Super Happy Fun Land; these kids are absolutely amazing! Fans of MMW and/or Drop Trio will eat this sh*t up. The good news is that they'll be back this Sunday night at The Rhythm Room at 9:00 PM sharp, followed by the GoodTrain Sessions.  Save a little energy for Sunday this weekend. You'll be glad that you did.</blockquote>Hear hear. And you can catch them on <a href="http://www.ktru.org">KTRU</a> being interviewed at 6pm on Sunday, too.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>Cool show on Friday night at <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays/">Brasil</a>. It was the first outing for the new Prophet 600, and it was immediately apparent that this little guy opens up whole new realms of sonic possibilities. Should also be an aid in working up our new prog rock song cycle, "The Robot Suit Trilogy". Haha. Um, that's true, actually. Anyway, thanks for coming out, we appreciate you.<br /><br />Also, thanks to Joe Montes from <a href="http://www.kpft.org/studio/playlistbuild.php?week=1&shownumber=14">Smokin' Joe's Roadhouse</a> on <a href="http://www.kpft.org">KPFT</a> for the shout-out yesterday. Joe was at our show on Friday night, in the front row, and he's kicking around plans for a Drop Trio-based supergroup to throw down some Saturday this fall for a live broadcast of Joe's Roadhose. Look out for it ...<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

We had a practice last night and got to unleash its sonic brutality for a few minutes. OK, well, maybe sonic brutality is the wrong phrase. Anyway, it's really cool, and makes tons of weird sounds.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.droptrio.com/blog/pr600.jpg" /></center><br /><br />Rumor has it Ian might try it out at <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays/">Brasil</a> this week. Be warned.<br /><br />(Also, just a reminder to anyone who didn't get the memo - our show with the Mike Clark Trio originally scheduled for tonight was cancelled a couple weeks ago, so don't go showing up at the Meridian looking for us. <a href="http://www.stagsheadpub.com/">Stag's head</a>, maybe, but not the Meridian.)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   Stupid Batteries</a></span><BR>
   </div>
    <div class="Post"><a name="109268392221144180">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>We had an excellent time yesterday at Revolution (in Bryan, TX). The show went off without a hitch. <br /><br />Wish we could say as much for the journey, though. As Patrick and I pulled out of Houston, heading north to pick Mike up in The Woodlands, we noticed the van's battry light had come on. No big deal, we thought; the engine started, right? But as we drove, the battery indicator slid steadily into the red. Despite the fact that Patrick and I have about as much collective car knowledge as a barbie doll, we realized that this is a "bad" thing. Fortunately for us, Mike has a pickup truck! So rather than risking it choking half way to Bryan, we made the executive decision to cram (and I do mean cram) our gear into the bed of the truck (thank God for good weather) and wedge ourselves into the front for the 2 hour journey. <br /><br />Did we make it? Yes. Were we happy? No. Let's just say that we're much closer now.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gnappyfunk.com">Gnappy</a> was playing when we arrived, and they kicked ass as usual. Their new material really shines. We are totally psyched to be playing not just one but three gigs with them (and Bagg) in early September.<br /><br />$tephen, a fan in Bryan, was there to meet us with his video camera when we arrived. He taped the whole show, plus some "behind the scenes" footage including all 3 of us looking silly before and after the show. If you ever get a chance to see it, you'll realize why we stick to playing music and avoid stand up comedy (mostly).<br /><br />    Good looking lady: "My nickname is Mojo."<br />    Ian: "Yeah? Mine is 'the singing duck'."<br />    Good looking lady: (silence)<br /><br />The set was incredible - 2 sets, actually - and we played till 2am. Everybody was grooving with us - we had a particularly cool run in Melody-Melody, which, even though it's a song we play a lot, never seems to lose its ability to inspire weird tangents and extended jams. We even had a dude get up and rap spontaneously in the middle of one song.<br /><br />The trip home was ... well ... long. Ian chased some ducks around a Whataburger, Mike had an extended conversation with a hand puppet, and <a href="http://www.mattress.com/">1-800-MATTRESS</a> was called at least once. We also learned that if Patrick falls asleep, it's best not to wake him up suddenly; he comes up fighting.<br /><br />After dropping Mike back in the Woodlands, we transferred all the gear back to the van and crossed our fingers for the ride home to Houston. Obviously, we didn't cross them hard enough. 2 hours later, the tow truck driver found Ian and Patrick asleep in the van on the side of I-45, and there was a beautiful sunrise. Stupid car batteries!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>We had an incredible time last night at <a href="http://www.jazzhouston.com/venues/about.jsp?key=7">Cezanne</a>. There was a great crowd, and we were happy to get a chance to play with a real grand piano. If they weren't so heavy, I think we'd start bringing one to all of our gigs. :)<br /><br />We got a recording of the evening, but the instrument balance wasn't great, so we're not going to post the whole thing. But here's a clip, for just a taste of what the evening was like:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/sets/2004-08-12_Cezanne/SecondFirst_Cip_Cezanne_2004-08-12.mp3"><img src="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/mp3.gif" border=0></a> - Second First (MP3, 2:09, 2.5 MB)<br /><br />Huge thank-you to Bill (the bartender) and Erin (the waitress) - you guys make Cezanne a great, friendly place to be. Huge thank you also to Doria from <a href="http://www.theredpub.com/music_Drop_Trio.html">The Red Pub</a> for putting the show together.<br /><br />We're heading east today, bound for Bryan, TX, where we're playing a show at Revolution (211B South Main). Spread the word to any Aggie friends! <a href="http://www.gnappyfunk.com">Gnappy</a> starts at 9:30, Drop Trio goes on at 11:30.<br /><br />And for those of you chilling in Houston tonight, you have 2 great choices. The Psychodillos are playing a special all instrumental jam funk set at <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays/">Funk Jazz Fridays</a> at Brasil. Also, over at Shoeshine Charlie's Big Top Lounge (next to the Continental Club - 3700 Main, Houston), you can catch <a href="http://clouseaux.tripod.com">Clouseaux's</a> release party for their new CD, and the going away show for drummer Claudio De Pujadas. Go over and wish him well on his travels, and pick up a copy of their latest.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

They have a zillion kinds of beer, and we'll play anywhere that has that kind of beer selection. Plus, they have great food. Not a huge crowd, but the folks that were there got a sneak preview of some tracks from Leap, and a few of the tunes we'll be pulling out at <a href="http://www.jazzhouston.com/venues/about.jsp?key=7">Cezanne's</a> on Thursday.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

There were some incredible moments, including (but not limited to) a tribute to the late Mr. Rick James, and some wacked out sounds from a vintage "Sequential Circuits" keyboard that Mark brought along. If you missed out, we got a good recording of the show, just <a href="mailto:info@droptrio.com">email us</a> if you'd like a copy. <br /><br />Next week at <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/funkjazzfridays">Funk Jazz Fridays</a>, don't miss a special all-instrumental set from the Psychodillos!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

The Cafe was packed, and we got to play sandwiched between Carolyn Wonderland and New Monsoon, which is better than we could have asked for. (Somebody told me we even had some of our set streamed live over <a href="http://www.kpft.org">KPFT</a>, unbeknownst to us, which is pretty cool.) We ate watermelon, we drank watermelon, I think at one point I was even sweating watermelon. Ew.

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>This is the Watermelon festival weekend! If you didn't already go by yesterday, make sure you head to <a href="http://www.lastconcert.com">Last Concert Cafe</a> today to check out one of Houston's most original and enduring festivals, where tons of bands take the stage and spread the love of watermelon and music to the Houston masses. Drop Trio takes the stage tonight around 11pm, just before New Monsoon rocks the house, so make sure you get there!<br /><br /><strong>NOTE</strong>: Just found out that our set goes 10:25 - 11:10 pm, so don't get there too late!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>
