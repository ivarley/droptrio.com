You can check 'em out on our photos page.

   Special Show @ Dean's with LBP</a></span><BR>
   </div>
    <div class="Post"><a name="111963414860476376">&nbsp;</a>
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>A little more than a month ago, <a href="http://littlebrotherproject.com">Little Brother Project</a> close friends, Jeff Dussair and Jarrod Murphy's home was lost to a fire.  If you've been to an LBP show, you probably met one of them.  Thank God, no one was hurt but they lost most of everything.<br /> <br />LBP and Drop Trio will be performing this Friday (6/24) at Deans Credit Clothing - 316 Main Street (downtown) in hopes of helping them get back on track.<br /> <br />There will be NO COVER but a donation of any size will be greatly appreciated.  A donation of $10 will get you a FREE LBP "Urban Ocean" CD. Jeff has said that one of the worst parts was losing all of his music, so we will also be accepting used (or new) CD's to help restart his collection.  I think he likes Cher and Michael Jackson (kidding, he likes Jam bands - surprise, surprise).<br /> <br />This will be a special show for LBP.  Not only will we be helping out our very good friends but it will also be - the first show since bassist Coy's heart transplant earlier this year, departing drummer Beatty's last show as he will be deployed to Iraq latter this summer and it will be new drummer Morris's Little Brother Project debut.<br /> <br />Doors at 8pm<br />DJ David Wingler 9-9:30<br />DROP TRIO from 9:30-10:30   <br />DJ David Wingler 10:30-11:00<br />LITTLE BROTHER PROJECT from 11:00-12:30<br />DJ David Wingler to end the night.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>Despite some rain on the way to Baton Rouge, we arrived intact. <a href="http://www.chelseascafe.com">Chelsea's</a> didn't disappoint - the <a href="http://www.chelseascafe.com/pages/557624/index.htm">soup</a> was awesome; the <a href="http://www.gordsellar.com/imagisme/archives/adjbct%20078.jpg">crew </a> was super friendly; and - as always - <a href="http://www.righteousbuddha.com">Righteous Buddha</a> was terrific.  On top of being fantastic musicians, <a href="http://www.righteousbuddha.com/images/200_Righteous_Buddha_04_002.jpg">John</a>, <a href="http://www.righteousbuddha.com/images/200_Righteous_Buddha_04_017.jpg">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://www.righteousbuddha.com/images/200_Righteous_Buddha_04_007.jpg">Dave</a> are about the friendliest group around. They were kind enough to share their <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/~djacques/Hammond%20B3%201961.jpg">gear</a> and break up the show into four sets so we got to play for the later crowd. If you haven't already, be sure to check them out on <a href="http://www.jamhouston.com">jamhouston.com</a>.<br /><br />We owe Dave an apology, though. He used some of Patrick's pedals and I fear we were egging him down the path of the <a href="http://darthside.blogspot.com/">dark side </a>. We're just doing our part to spread "some crazy music".  Is that wrong?<br /><br />Today we're making the relatively short jog to <a href="http://www.neworleansonline.com/"> New Orleans</a>. We're looking forward to playing for the folks at <a href="http://www.bordersbooks.com">Borders Books</a> and introducing a <a href="http://www.jamhouston.com/news/acesxsw/ace85x85.jpg">wayward yankee</a> to the Big Easy.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>The <a href="http://www.logoncafe.net/">Logon Café</a> is my new favorite spot in Beaumont.  Last night we had a blast and enjoyed haning out with Jason, Ryan, A.J., MIke, Mandy, and all the folks that turned out for the show.  And, as ever, <a href="http://www.johnfulbright.com/">John Fulbright</a> deserves many thanks for his support and encouragement - both from Drop Trio and the Beaumont community.  Thanks John!<br /><br />So, after a little rest, we're heading to Baton Rouge tonight.  It's been a while since we've been there and we're totally looking forward to it.  We'll be at <a href="http://www.chelseascafe.com/pages/557622/index.htm"> Chelsea's Café</a> tonight with our friends <a href="http://www.righteousbuddha.com/pages/1/index.htm">Righteous Buddha</a>.  When we were there last, the music was rockin' and they had the best tomato basil soup.<br /><br />I always have fun in Louisiana.  I think a stop in <a href="http://www.visitlakecharles.org/lake-charles-casinos.asp">Lake Charles </a> might be in order, too.  My <a href="http://www.pokerroom.com">skills</a> are getting rusty and we've still got some gas money left.  <a href="http://bkman.20megsfree.com/stfu.swf">(Don't tell Ian or Nuje)</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>So, OK, we learned in the past couple weeks - it's hard to put up <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/live.html">live archive</a> tracks when you're on the road. So this week we've jumped the gun and put up a track today. It's a recording of <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/sets/2004-05-07_Chelseas/DropTrio_2004-05-07_Chelseas_0106_Cognac.mp3">Cognac Morning</a> from the last time we hit <a href="http://www.chelseascafe.com/">Chelsea's Cafe</a> (in Baton Rouge, LA). Share and enjoy. And <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Music/live.xml">podcast</a>.<br /><br />And speaking of <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/">podcasting</a>, keep your eyes on <a href="http://www.49media.com">49 Media</a>, there will be a radio interview with Ian there in the next couple days about the band, podcasting, technology, and life as a geek. Fun listening.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>The drive from Lubbock to <a href="http://www.qsl.net/kcarc/">Abilene</a> was no problem.  I tried out our new <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22closest+packing+theory%22&btnG=Google+Search"> packing strategy</a> that allows a human (hieght = Patrick) to lay prone.  Not the most   comfortable <a href="http://www.epinions.com/inst-Amplifiers-All-SWR_Silverado_Special_Bass_Combo">bed</a> design but I was able to catch a couple of winks.  (Also note, height Patrick < height Ian < height Nuje).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thebeancountercoffee.com/">The Bean Counter</a> turned out great.  The west Texas sky threatened rain, but we played outside anyway.  Lisa and the crew were great and most everybody encouraged our performance.  Too, our friend <a href="http://www.texnews.com/local97/elvis081697.html">Joe</a> showed up and gave us his seal of approval.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there was some <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22dirt+convention%22&btnG=Google+Search"> event</a> going on in town and we had to drive a fair bit to find a room.  As you can imagine, they didn't have free lotion or shoe shine service - but they did have rags (seriously) available in every room.<br /><br />We had a blast this weekend and made some new friends.

   <div style="clear:both;"></div>The drive was a bit longer than expected but we arrived in Lubbock from Norman without a problem.  In fact, we arrived with time enough for a nap at the hotel.  Patrick tried to go for a relaxing swim.  The pool was nice enough, but relaxing just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22babies+are+not+smart%22&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">  wasn't in</a><a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=crying+babies&btnG=Search"> the cards</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jakes-sportscafe.com/">Jake's</a> was great last night.  Texas Tech isn't in session and we worried that all the "space jazz hipsters" left town.  Although we didn't have the crowd we did last time plenty of folks were asking for our tunes by name. A huge thanks to Andrew, Nic, Scott and the gang.<br /><br />Andrew gets a double thanks for also hooking Jake's up with some killer subs.  He got some plans from <a href="http://www.secure-prosound.com/prosound/FMPro?-DB=serveletv1.fp5&-format=home.htm&-view">www.prosound.com</a> and built them himself.  Patrick finally got a chance to <a href="http://fr.audiofanzine.com/produits/index,idproduit,15598.html"> dive bomb down 2 octaves</a> and stay down.<br /><br />We're off to try the pool (again) before a thankfully shorter drive to Abilene.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>&nbsp;<BR><BR>

You guys rock in Oklahoma.<br /><br />One thing we learned at the show is that beer in Oklahoma is only 3.2%. So they give it to you in great big cups. Which is great, except that I don't think I've ever had to pee so many times during a show.
